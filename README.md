Problem Statement-
The current systems for managing research, intellectual property rights (IPR),
innovation activities, and start-up growth are fragmented and inefficient.
Information is scattered across various departments and platforms, resulting in
poor data accessibility, lack of transparency, and suboptimal resource allocation. A
unified system is required to streamline monitoring, improve collaboration, and
support stakeholders across the innovation ecosystem.
